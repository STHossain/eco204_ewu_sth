 <img src="assets/images/children_unicef.jpeg" width="400" height="200" > 

Only 64 percent of the children go on to complete the secondary education. Don't you think this is worrying? We have 58 million children, who represent 34 percent population, so surely they will be the future workforce so question is *are going in the direction?* [*The Credit for image goes to to unicef.org click [here](https://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/en/education) to see the actual page.*]

Economists often think about these problems, try to find useful numbers / statistics (like 64 in this example), analyze these numbers, and finally try to solve this problem at the policy level. So numbers are important, **Statistics is important**

### Course Description
This is a continuation of the course ECO104. The students will be introduced to Inferential Statistics, and the core topics are:

1. Point and Interval Estimation of Mean and Proportion (one sample and two sample problems)
2. Hypothesis Testing of Mean and Proportion (one sample and two sample problems)
3. Simple and Multiple Linear Regression Model, Estimation and Testing.
4. Basic Time Series Analysis
5. Goodness of fit test and some non-parametric tests (e.g., sign test and rank test), if time permits!
6. Analysis of Variance Techniques.

The course follows a balanced approach between theory and practice. Students will learn the concepts and also apply them using R. There will be a lab project to evaluate the applied skills.

### Prerequisite Courses
- ECO101 and ECO104 offered at the East West University.

### Textbooks / Notes
There will be lecture notes (typed), and you should definitely read that first. In addition, I recommend to use any of the following books for exercises and practice problems:

1. Anderson, Sweeney, Williams, Camm, Cochran, Fry and Ohlmann (2020)
2. Newbold, Carlson and Thorne (2020)

Following books are a bit advanced at this level, but nevertheless these are also excellent references. In particular, if you are an Economics student, you should look into Wooldridge (2019).

- DeGroot and Schervish (2012)
- Casella and Berger (2002)
- Wooldridge (2019)

### Marks Distribution
- **Problem Sets:** 5%
- **Quizzes:** 15%
- **Lab Project:** 10%
- **Midterm 1:** 20%
- **Midterm 2:** 20%
- **Final Exam:** 30%

#### Additional Details:
- **Problem Sets:** Usually there will be a problem set every two weeks, and it has to be turned in with your attempted solutions by the following week. Please form groups of a maximum of 3 and submit in groups. DO the problem set seriously!
- **Quizzes:** In total there will be 6 random quizzes (i.e., they can happen any day during the whole semester!) I will take the average of the best 3.
- **Lab Project:** Lastly, there will be a Lab Project. We will talk about the details later in class.
